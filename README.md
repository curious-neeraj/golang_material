Some Salient Feature of GO -

- Go is **Statically Typed Language**\
You either have to tell the type explicitly while declaring, or provide a value so that it may infer the type from the value.

- Go is **Strongly Typed Language**\
The operations allowed to be performed on variables are strictly based on their types (example, you cannot add (+) a string and int value)

- Go is a **Compiled Language**

- Go has a **Fast Compile Time**\
The compilation time of Go programs is pretty less. It is thus suitable even for production setup.

- Go has **Built-In Concurrency**\
Go inheritly supports concurrency via concepts like *go routines*.

- Go has **Built-In Garbage Collector**\
The garbage collection in Go is automatic which makes it simple to use for the users as they don't have to handle all this by themselves.

## Basics
Initialize Go Module
'''
go mod init <module-name>
'''

Build a Go program file to generate a binary file
'''
go build <file-name-with-extension>
'''

Run the compiled binary file
'''
./<file-name>
'''

Build and Run in one *Go* ðŸ˜‰
'''
go run <file-name-with-extension>
'''
