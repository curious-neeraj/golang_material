# Golang Study Material
Repository to keep some basic teaching material for golang handy.

Some Salient Feature of GO -

- Go is **Statically Typed Language**\
You either have to tell the type explicitly while declaring, or provide a value so that it may infer the type from the value.

- Go is **Strongly Typed Language**\
The operations allowed to be performed on variables are strictly based on their types (example, you cannot add (+) a string and int value)

- Go is a **Compiled Language**

- Go has a **Fast Compile Time**\
The compilation time of Go programs is pretty less. It is thus suitable even for production setup.

- Go has **Built-In Concurrency**\
Go inheritly supports concurrency via concepts like *go routines*.

- Go has **Built-In Garbage Collector**\
The garbage collection in Go is automatic which makes it simple to use for the users as they don't have to handle all this by themselves.
The important point to note here is that Go, unline Java's whole JVM, packs a small piece of extra code called ***Go Runtime*** which manages garbage collection.

## Basics
Initialize Go Module
```
go mod init <module-name>
```

Build a Go program file to generate a binary file
```
go build <file-name-with-extension>
```

Run the compiled binary file
```
./<file-name>
```

Build and Run in one *Go* ðŸ˜‰
```
go run <file-name-with-extension>
```

> Generally we use a Makefile to set these commands and use `make <command>` instead.

## Data Types and Variables

>**Data-types :**
1. int, int8, int16, int32, int64, uint, uint8, uint16, uint32, uint64 -- _default value = 0_
2. float32, float64 -- _default value = 0_
3. rune -- _default value = 0_
4. string -- _default value = ''_
5. bool -- _default value = false_

>**Variables :**

There are multiple ways of declaring a variable
1. _var_ \<variable-name> _data_type_
2. _var_ \<variable-name> = \<value>
3. \<variable-name> := \<value>

> Outside of a function (in the global/package scope), every statement begins with a keyword (var, func, and so on) and so the := construct is not available.

>**Constants :**

Constants are used to have a value tied to a key (and make it immutable)
Declaring a constant - `const <key> <type> = value`

**Note - We cannot use `:=` for constants**

## Array
- Same Type
- Fixed Length
- Indexable (Zero indexed)
- Contiguous Memory Allocation
```
var intArr1 [3]int // Filled with Default value of datatype
intArr2 := [3]int{1, 2, 3}
intArr3 := [...]int{1, 2, 3, 4, 5} // Without specifying exact length

```

## Slice
- Wrapper around Array
- Convenient Interface to sequence of data
```
var intSlice []int = []int{1, 2, 3, 4}
intSlice = append(intSlice, 5)

// Appending multiple elements to slice
intSlice2 := []int{6, 7}
intSlice = append(intSlice, intSlice2...)	
```

## Map
- Key, Value pair
- Always return a value, even if key doesn't exist
```
// Empty Map - map1 = map[]
// key type -> string, value type -> int
var map1 map[string]int = make(map[string]int)

//Initialized Map
map2 := map[string]int{"Neeraj": 11, "AI": 10}
	
// Delete value from map
delete(map2, "AI")
```

## String, Rune
- String is immutable in Go
- String is a collection of UTF-8 values in Go (instead of char)
- Rune = Unicode point numbers representing characters / Alias for int32
```
// This would tell us that the type of indexed value in string isnt char
var str string = "neeraj"
fmt.Printf("value = %v, type = %T \n", str[0], str[0])

var str2 = []rune("neeraj")
fmt.Printf("value = %v, type = %T \n", str2[0], str2[0])
```

## Structure and Interface
- Structures are used to define custom types
- Interface is very helpful in making generic type functions over different types
```
type employee struct {
	id   int
	name string
	dept
}

type dept struct {
	deptName string
}

// Method tied to Structure
func (e employee) department() string {
	return e.deptName
}
```

## Pointers
- Pointers in Go are similar to those in C++
- Used to store memory address
```
// Default value = nil
var p *int

// Assign address of variable 'i'
var i int = 10
p = &i

// Change value of 'i' using pointer 'p'
*p = 11
```

## Generics
- We can have Generic type to make functions reusable
- Similar to template in C++
```
// Keeping type of parameter and return value Generic
func addGeneric[T int | float32 | float64](val1 T, val2 T) T {
	// Initializing sum - generic type T
	var sum T = val1 + val2
	fmt.Printf("Sum = %v \n", sum)
	return sum
}
```
