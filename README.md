Repository to keep some basic teaching material for golang handy.

Some Salient Feature of GO -

- Go is **Statically Typed Language**\
You either have to tell the type explicitly while declaring, or provide a value so that it may infer the type from the value.

- Go is **Strongly Typed Language**\
The operations allowed to be performed on variables are strictly based on their types (example, you cannot add (+) a string and int value)
